     * Return the string representation as a URI reference.
     *
     * Depending on which components of the URI are present, the resulting
     * string is either a full URI or relative reference according to RFC 3986,
     * Section 4.1. The method concatenates the various components of the URI,
     * using the appropriate delimiters:
     *
     * - If a scheme is present, it MUST be suffixed by ":".
     * - If an authority is present, it MUST be prefixed by "//".
     * - The path can be concatenated without delimiters. But there are two
     *   cases where the path has to be adjusted to make the URI reference
     *   valid as PHP does not allow to throw an exception in __toString():
     *     - If the path is rootless and an authority is present, the path MUST
     *       be prefixed by "/".
     *     - If the path is starting with more than one "/" and no authority is
     *       present, the starting slashes MUST be reduced to one.
     * - If a query is present, it MUST be prefixed by "?".
     * - If a fragment is present, it MUST be prefixed by "#".
     *
     * @see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.1
